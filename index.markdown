Who am I

I'm a dedicated learner with a passion for exploring diverse fields, ranging from [project management](/projects) and [supramolecular chemistry](/Publications/) to computer science and QA Automation testing 

I thrive on curiosity and love diving deep into different fields and subjects. Currently, I'm focusing my learning journey on automation testing and .NET development.
